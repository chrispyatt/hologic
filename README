# This set of scripts takes a Hologic tomography object
# and converts the data object to more standard DICOM
# such that it can be read by conventional DICOM reader
# software.

# There are two scripts under the hood, the first of which
# (converto.sh) uses command line unix tools to retrieve
# the unrecognised private data elements from the provided
# Hologic object and saves this data into a binary dump file.
# The second script (converto.py) uses PyDicom libraries to
# read the above mentioned binary data and construct a new 
# data object that conforms to standard DICOM.

# The wrapper script (HologicConvWrapper.sh) is how the user
# should interact with the system. Simply provide an image
# file and the output should be a fully compliant DICOM.

# The final important component is the Hologic private
# data dictionary (hologic_private.dic) that tells the tools
# how to interpret the private data tags in the input images.

# Dependencies
# Command line
# `---bash
# `---dcmtk
# `---dciodvfy
# Python
# `---python3
# `---pydicom
# `---os
# `---argparse
# `---numpy

# USAGE
#
# bash HologicConvWrapper.sh $IMAGEFILE $NAME
#
# where $IMAGEFILE is the filename of the image to convert
# and $NAME is an identifier/ sample name that will be used
# when saving the output to a new file.
